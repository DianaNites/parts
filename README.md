# Parts, a GPT partition manager

Read, create, and manipulate GPT tables/partitions in pure Rust.

## Usage

NOTE: Please don't use this, it's new, WIP, and untested.
Back up your data, or only use it on virtual disks.

The code is well documented but unpolished, and the API is unstable.

## Features

## Goals

* Pure Rust
* Able to round-trip existing valid tables. ex: read, then write out, exactly the same.
